            <section class="docs-section">
              <h2>Definition of Metrics</h2>
              <h3>Awareness</h3>
              <p>
                Awareness refers to the extent to which the users can
                effectively perceive the information displayed on the privacy
                controls. It demonstrates the usability of privacy controls
                through factors such as visibility and the ease of locating and
                accessing displayed information. This attribute encompasses two
                key features, which are <strong>location</strong> and
                <strong>display type</strong>.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Location:</strong> The placement of privacy controls
                  on a website plays a significant role in determining user
                  awareness and the visibility of privacy-related content. When
                  privacy controls are prominently displayed, users are more
                  likely to notice and interact with them. Conversely, if
                  privacy controls are not strategically positioned, there is a
                  higher chance that users will overlook them. For example, a
                  privacy notice positioned at the top of the screen would
                  garner greater attention compared to one placed in the
                  bottom-left corner.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Display Type:</strong> The display type includes the
                  layout formats and visual characteristics of privacy controls.
                  Effective display types such as the pop-up window help users
                  quickly grasp the content of the privacy control and enhance
                  their awareness of the privacy practices employed by the
                  website. This aspect is particularly crucial for privacy
                  nudges and privacy notices, as they often have different
                  display formats compared to privacy policies, which are
                  typically presented as plain text only.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Efficiency</h3>
              <p>
                Efficiency refers to the measurement of the time and effort
                required for users to access their desired privacy controls.
                When evaluating privacy settings, for instance, this attribute
                considers the time it takes for users to locate and modify their
                privacy settings, as well as the overall intuitiveness of the
                process. This attribute includes one key element, which is the
                number of clicks required for accessing the privacy control.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Number of clicks:</strong> The number of clicks
                  correlates with the ease of accessing the privacy information
                  and settings. By reducing the number of clicks, the user
                  experience can be significantly improved as it simplifies the
                  navigation process and saves time for the user.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Comprehension</h3>
              <p>
                The comprehension aspect of usability for privacy controls,
                particularly for privacy policies and settings, pertains to the
                extent to which users can understand and interpret the
                information provided. Comprehension encompasses two primary
                features: language and the presence of a table of contents.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Language:</strong> The language focuses on the
                  readability and clarity of the text used in privacy controls.
                  It emphasizes that the information presented should be easily
                  understandable by a diverse audience. To achieve this,
                  websites should provide the option to translate privacy
                  control content into multiple languages.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Table of contents:</strong> A table of contents refers
                  to the inclusion of a structured and organised outline within
                  privacy policies or settings. Typically, it consists of
                  hyperlinks that enable users to easily navigate to specific
                  subsections within the text. The presence of a table of
                  contents serves as a valuable tool for users to swiftly grasp
                  the sections and topics covered in lengthy texts and quickly
                  access the information they are interested in.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Functionality</h3>
              <p>
                Functionality assesses the extent to which a privacy control
                encompasses various categories of privacy content. It measures
                the types of privacy data that are covered or disclosed. For
                instance, a properly designed and functional privacy notice
                should provide information about a wide range of privacy aspects
                and the types of data that are collected.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Type of privacy content:</strong> The type of privacy
                  content refers to the breadth of privacy data topics addressed
                  by privacy controls, including areas such as advertisements,
                  cookies, email notifications, and other relevant aspects. A
                  high coverage of these privacy content types ensures that
                  information about the website's privacy data collection
                  practices is effectively communicated to users.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Choice</h3>
              <p>
                In addition, we consider the influence of dark patterns on the
                usability of privacy controls through the
                <strong>choice</strong> attribute. This attribute evaluates
                whether the websites provide meaningful options and clear
                guidance for users to manage their privacy preferences. It
                covers two crucial features: the types of options available to
                users, and the choice guidance provided.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Types of options:</strong> In privacy controls such as
                  nudges, users should be presented with options to exercise
                  control over their privacy preferences. These options may
                  include accepting or declining all data-sharing practices, as
                  well as managing certain aspects of their own privacy
                  preferences.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Explicit choice guidance:</strong> Clear choice
                  guidance involves concise steps and actionable instructions to
                  explain each option provided in privacy controls. It is
                  essential for users to understand the implications of their
                  choices and make informed privacy decisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Nudging Patterns:</strong> Nudging patterns refer to
                  the design elements of a privacy choice interface that
                  influence users to select certain options over others,
                  sometimes utilizing dark patterns to encourage less
                  privacy-protective decisions. Dark patterns are increasingly
                  used to coerce users into accepting default or less secure
                  privacy settings. One prevalent example is the use of a
                  privacy nudge for cookie selection, where the design of the
                  interface guides users to make specific choices.
